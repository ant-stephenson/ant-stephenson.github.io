# Background
I graduated from the University of Cambridge back in 2014 with a Masterâ€™s degree in Natural Sciences, specializing in theoretical physics. Since then, I have worked in London for over 5 and a half years as a Data Scientist, building predictive models for football match outcomes. I have broad research interests, but I am currently focused on developing large scale non-linear Bayesian inference methods, by, for example, improving scalability of Gaussian Processes, or studying uncertainty representations in Bayesian Neural Networks.
