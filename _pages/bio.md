# Background
I graduated from the University of Cambridge in 2014 with a Masterâ€™s degree in
Natural Sciences, specializing in theoretical physics. Since then I have worked
in London for over 5 and a half years as a Data Scientist (and then Senior Data Scientist), building predictive
models for football match outcomes. At present I am doing post-graduate research
on improving scalability of Gaussian Processes at the University of Bristol.
